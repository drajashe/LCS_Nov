# Performance Management tool
- This  tool is built to ease an human resource person to get the true posture of an employee by analyze the feedback postures with predicted postures. 
- It's infered that many of our colleagues fail to predict our posturing unlike our ML modules which accurately predicts our requirements.

This Projects basically Uses: 
1. Uses python and few of its libraries like pandas,tkinter for form generation.
    - This form takes in user information.
2. Our main model used for predicting the results uses the Machine learning modules like - Ramdom forest, Decision Trees, and tensorflow - keras classifier for prediction.
3. Visualization   
   
### Python GUI – tkinter
- Python offers multiple options for developing GUI (Graphical User Interface). Out of all the GUI methods, tkinter is most commonly used method. It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with tkinter outputs the fastest and easiest way to create the GUI applications. Creating a GUI using tkinter is an easy task.

### Importing the module – tkinter
- Create the main window (container)
- Add any number of widgets to the main window
- Apply the event Trigger on the widgets.
- Importing tkinter is same as importing any other module in the python code. Note that the name of the module in Python 2.x is ‘Tkinter’ and in Python 3.x is ‘tkinter’.
